    <p>This book is designed to make learning SQL as straightforward as possible. It is a
        concise, step-by-step course, written in plain English, with a focus on using what you
        learn. It gives examples of SQL (known as “queries”) which you can run on your home
        computer, and explains how they work. After that, this book gives practice exercises, so
        that you can try out what you learn, before moving on. Later chapters show how to
        combine the basics to write more advanced queries.
        When a new technical term is introduced, this course will give a definition, or plainEnglish equivalent, at that point.
        The software needed to practice SQL will run on a home PC or laptop and is freely
        available online. This book will guide you through downloading and installing the correct
        version for your machine.
        Let’s get started</p>
